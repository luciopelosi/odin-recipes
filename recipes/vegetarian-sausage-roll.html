    <h3>Ingridients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>200g chestnut mushrooms</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 leeks, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sage, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp brown rice miso</li>
        <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>30g chestnuts, very finely chopped</li>
        <li>60g mature cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>70g fresh white breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 x 320g sheet ready rolled all butter puff pastry</li>
        <li>1 medium egg, light beaten to glaze</li>

        <h3>Method</h3>
    
        <h4>Step1</h4>

        <p>Put the mushrooms in a food processor and pulse until they're very finely chopped.</p>

        <h4>Step2</h4> 

        <p>Put half the olive oil in a large frying pan and add the leeks along with a pinch of salt.</p>
        <p>Fry gently for 15 mins or until softened and golden brown. Scrape the leeks out of the pan and into a bowl.</p>
        <p>Heat the remaining oil in the pan and fry the mushrooms for 10 mins over a medium heat. Add the garlic, sage,</p>
        <p>miso and mustard and fry for another minute, then leave to cool slightly.</p>


        <h4>Step3</h4>
        
        <p>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Combine the mushroom mixture with the leeks in a bowl, add the chestnuts,</p>
        <p>cheese and breadcrumbs. Season lightly to taste (the miso and leeks will add salt, so donâ€™t add too much) and</p>
        <p>work everything together until you have a slightly stodgy mixture.</p>

        <h4>Step4</h4>

        <p>Unravel the puff pastry on a floured surface, then roll out so one side measures about 40cm. Push the mushroom mixture</p>
        <p>down the centre of the pastry. Bring the pastry around the mixture and seal the edges with a fork, then cut into 8 pieces.</p>
        <p>Lay on a lined baking sheet and brush each one with the beaten egg. Bake in the oven for 25-30 mins until deep, golden brown.</p>
        <p>Allow to cool a little before eating.</p>

        <h5>Bon Appetit!!</h5>
