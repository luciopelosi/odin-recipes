    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Even a novice cook can master the art of <em>pizza</em> with our simple step-by-step guide. Bellissimo!</p>

    <p><strong>Prep:</strong>25 min</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Cook:</strong>10 min</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>

    <h3>For the base</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
        <h4>For the tomato sauce</h4>
        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <h4>For the topping</h4>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
        <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>

        <h3>Method</h3>
    
        <h4>Step1</h4>

        <p>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml</p>
        <p>warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough.</p>
        <p>Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside.</p>
        <p>You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p>

    

        <h4>Step2</h4> 

        <p>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at</p>
        <p>room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p>


        <h4>Step3</h4>
        
        <p>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls.</p>
        <p>On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin.</p>
        <p>The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p>

        <h4>Step4</h4>

        <p>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven</p>
        <p>on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with</p>
        <p>olive oil and season. Put one <em>pizza</em>, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray.</p>
        <p>Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using.</p>
        <p>Repeat step for remaining <em>pizza.</em></p>

        <h5>Buon Appetito!!</h5>
